# Larg Language Model  
## List of contents  
Week 1  
* Transformer Network
* Genitive AI Project Life Cycle
* Prompt Engineering
  
Week 2
* Instruction fine-tunning
  * Increase performance of the existing model for specific use case > using fine-tuning > to further train a base model
  * fine-tuning with instruction prompt > fine-tune LLM = instruct LLM
  * use an existing dataset with [prompt, completion] > supervised learning instead of self supervised learning
  * full fine-tuning > The process results in a new version of the model with updated weights.
  * Evaluate performance > cross entropy function 
* Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
